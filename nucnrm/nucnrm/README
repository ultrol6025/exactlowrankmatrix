Interior-point code for nuclear norm minimization (version 1.0). 

Copyright (c) 2009 Zhang Liu and Lieven Vandenberghe.

The algorithm is described in the paper "Interior-point method for nuclear 
norm approximation with application to system identification" 
(Z. Liu and L. Vandenberghe) 
<http://www.ee.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/publications/nucnrm.pdf>.


The file nucnrm.py contains a function nrmapp() for solving linear nuclear 
norm approximation problems with quadratic regularization.

The file sysid.py contains functions for system identification based on
regularized nuclear norm minimization.

Three examples are included:

    ex_nna.py: solves a randomly generated example

    ex_sysid.py: a system identification example

    ex_tradeoff.py: plots a trade-off curve of nuclear norm || A(X) - B||_*
        verxus || x - x0 ||_2^2.
